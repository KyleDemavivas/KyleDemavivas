<p align="justify">common name for a tree of the rose family, 
native of eastern Asia, and for its fruit. The tree is small, with heart-shaped leaves on long stalks. Solitary white flowers appear before the leaves, and the fruit,
which resembles the peach, is roundish, downy, yellow, and sometimes ruddy on one side, white yellow flesh. More than 20 kinds are distinguished. Some favorites are Moorpark, 
of english origin, with a large, round, orange-red freestine, ripening in the middle of the season; Newcastle, of California origin, with medium-size round, with a large, oblate, 
yellow red freestine, ready early in the season. The fruit, somewhat smaller than a peach, is known for its delicate flavor. It is marketed fresh, as well as dried and packed, 
Large quantities are canned or pulped for jam making. California and Oregon are the leading producers in the United States. It is also significant crop in British Columbia (Canada), 
Australia, Italy, the south of France and Israel.

<p align="justify">common name for certain plants of the rose family, and for their ripe, cap-shaped fruits, which separate form the floral stalks or receptacle when picked. Raspberries are
native to the North Temperate Zone. The European red raspberry was one of the first European plants to be introduced into America. The American red raspberry, native to 
the eastern United States, produces fruit that is slightly inferior in quality to the European species, although it is better suited to the climate of the United States. 
The black raspberry of the norhtern United States is also hardy and productive. Many varieties of raspberry now common in cultivation in commericial and graden plantings 
are derived from the above-mentioned three species; their fruits, ranging from black through purple and red to yellow, are used fresh, for home and commericial preserving, 
and for flavors and syrups. The insect enemies of cultivated raspberries include the raspberry sawfly and two cane-boring beetles. The principal diseases of the plant are 
the virus-caused mosaic leaf yellows, anthracnose, and the raspberry orange rust.

<image src="images\blackberry.jpg" alt="wag" align="left">
<p align="justify">common name for several of the fruits and plants of a genus of the rose family. The ripe fruit is an aggregate of small, purplish-black drupes attached to a cone-shaped 
receptacle, which readily separates from the plant when the berries are picked. In other members of the genus, the receptacle separates from the drupes and remains on the 
plant (see Raspberry). More than 24 species of blackberry are known, including several called dewberry and albino varieties called white blackberry. One of the most common 
species is the sow-teat blackberry. Although the blackberry was highly developed as a wild fruit, it was raely grown as a garden fruit until about 1850. Since then, it has 
been widely cultivated and has become a major commercial crop.

<image src="images\strawberry.jpg" alt="wag" align="left">
<p align="justify">common name for low, perennial herbs of a genus of the rose family, and also for the edible fruit of these herbs. Strawberries are native to temperate regions throughout the 
world. All cultivated strawberries were developed from four principal species. The wood strawberry (Fragia vesca) is a fragile woodland species native to the mountains of Mexico, 
South America, and the West Indies. The meadow strawberry (F. virginiana) of eastern North America was introduced to Europe during the 17th century. The beach strawberry 
(F. chiloensis) is native to the mountainous areas in the western hemisphere. The fourth species (F. moschata) is common in Central Europe. Most of the numerous varieties of 
strawberries under cultivation today were developed fron the North American varieties.</p>
